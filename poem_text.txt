“Run Away”

Another end of a worthless day
All my friends tell me I need to stay
But my hope is so bent out of shape
Why can't I just take you and escape?

I've got the parents yelling at me
Tears sting my eyes until I can't see
Let's pack our bags today and flee
To find a place that'll let us be

It would be so much worse if I didn't have you
You're the only thing holding me back, it's true
I'll admit it's overused and cliché
But you and I should run away

We can tear our lives from their chaos
Our paths with them will never cross
We'll sever our ties with the past
Their bond on us will never last


“Omen”

This morning I woke up
And stepped outside
Looked up above me
And almost cried

It was cool and foggy
But in the sky
There were no clouds showing
The sun up high

And all I was thinking
Just left my mind
Seeing sun rays through the fog
Thoughts left behind

Could this be an omen?
Is this a sign?
Is this where I'm heading?
Maybe divine?

With such a light shining through
Maybe one taste
Of good fortune to come
No time to waste

Perhaps I'll be noticed
By my own mind
Who I was thinking of
Will now be kind


“The Last of Me”

I lay here half awake
These bones weren't meant to break
My heart cannot take it
She's ready to just quit
Inside my lungs collapsed
My voice is weak and rasped
As I lay here dying
I'm bleeding and crying
And yet I must recite
The last poem I may write
“Drowning”

Just wash me away
Away to the sea
Detached from the earth
Where's it's only me

Alone I can float
There laying facedown
No rescue out here
It's likely I'll drown

The sun starts to set
Left out here too long
No stars out tonight
All my light is gone

Now I start sinking
To the ocean's floor
Last breaths escaping
Existing no more


“J’aime Le Loup”

J'aime le loup
Et ils m'aiment beaucoup

Nous parcourons de bois ensemble
Il n'est pas aussi moyen qu'il semble

Nous hurlons à la lune
Quand la nuit est jeune

Et la danse sous les étoiles
Il n'est jamais hostile

Son pelage est mou
Ses yeux sont comme des bijoux

J'aime le loup
Et ils m'aiment beaucoup


“Life Lines”

Rain comes down to rid my tears
Thunder scares away my fears
Lightning keeps me holding on
Although I hate life and want it done

The moon lights my dull life
The stars steer me from sacrifice
The sun helps me in only one way
He lets me see the next day

The page keeps my mind at bay
The pen is my friend who which I play
Colored pencils keep me sane
When I venture down a dark lane


“Hanging”

You left me hanging on a line
You left me swinging on a vine
You left me,
yet you lead me

I'm moving forward with no motion at all
I'm making my way through this wall
You forget the past,
but my memory lasts

Love once touched and now makes me sick
Are you just some sort of trick?
I'm here and shackled, yet totally free
What the heck did you do to me?


“Still Here”

I'm still here
And I wait
The end isn't near
It isn't over yet
At least for me
You did something you will regret
I'm hanging on
By a single thread
And if you care,
I'm not dead


“I Want To Be Your Dew”

On a cold chilly morning when the fog still hangs over the land,
I want to wake up next to you when through the night we were holding hands

Soon the sun will burn it's way through the early morning mists
And we will have said so many "I love you's" that there are now too many to list

If I were to ever ask anything at all of you,
I would ask "Can you be the grass so I can cling to you like the dew?"
“Explosion”

When I first saw you walk through the school gates
The bomb in my chest began to create
When you held me before anyone came
Set up the matches so they could strike a flame

When you took my hand through out the first half
Set up the dynamite and cut out a path
When you held me close during the break
Set up the fuse so the flame could take

For the second part you nuzzled my face
Everything was perfect and put into place
After the show when we searched for a spot to choose
Was when the sternum was lit: My heart's fuse

When we sat on the cold cement block
The time remaining away ticked and tocked
When under the blue umbrella we began to embrace
Was when the explosions began to take place

The bomb that is my heart took it's course
Raging fireballs of joy through me endorsed
The kisses right now that I'm longing for
The loving fiery passionate inferno

The shards of my once broken life flew
They blast away when I'm with you
One would think that the destruction would be a disaster
But this explosion is the work of a master

I'd happily kill ten thousand men
Just to taste your soft lips again
In the cold under the night
How could this feeling get any more right?


“Sweetly, Softly Dreaming”

Sweetly, sweetly, softly dreaming under the black sky
It was that face that just so happened to catch my blinded eye
Now you're dreaming sweetly in a magic illusion land
I hope you're sweetly, softly dreaming of us holding hands


“Clearly Now”

Speak clearly now, my dear
There is nothing more to fear

It is the time to rise from the ruins
And run by the light of the moon

We will be safe in a new found place
In our hearts for now there is space

Together we'll break from the gloom
And maybe something beautiful will bloom


“Write You Out”

In every epic play,
There are characters
And those characters find a way,
To remain in the play

Let's say I'm the playwright
The person who writes the play
And I can do what I might
Because I'm the playwright

Now we need a plot
For the characters to follow
That poor pathetic lot,
Has to follow this dismal plot

One character I do not need
He makes the lead character hurt
If misery was the plant; he is the seed
I'll get rid of the one I don't need

So in the final draft, I'll write you out
The audience loves my piece
They cheer for encore while you pout
All because I happily wrote you out


“A Ce Moment”

À ce moment
Ill y a charnement
Cette adrénaline
Je perds l’autodiscipline
À ce moment

Libre comme un cheval
Un sentiment si abyssal
Je pourrais voler
Personne ne peut m’emprisonner
À ce moment

J’ai été trouvé
Et cela éprouvé
Comme j’ai cultivé un cœur
Et ma vie illuminée
À ce moment


“The Homework Poem”

It may be a pain to do,
Especially when you have no clue.
But in fact it is a fair trade,
Because it's only more for teachers to grade.


“This Is Not Strike One”

You weren't even close to a first strike today
Things were just blown proportionally out of the way
Don't even tell yourself you think you got close
Because I hold you in my heart different from most

I'd rather myself send the ball soaring
Just to stop misguided tears from pouring
I'll keep us out of danger from that strike
We're still learning how we're more and more alike

Don't worry, I'm on your team this time
I promise you that I'm becoming sublime
I won't be like the shadows of your past
I swear I will make our love through time last

I'd pay the umpire or cheat the game
There will never be a strike to proclaim
I've played this field in those same shoes
So I know exactly what you're going through


“Writers War”

Bloodied bruises and broken bones
Our pens meet but never our swords
Over mind-fulls of galloping words
The clash and bang of varnack wars
Soldiers of inspiration try what they were taught
To overcome the haze of writer’s block


“Collision Under the Influence”

Feeling numb and dumb they come
Towards the taillights of the track
Sobriety never neared and now the worst is feared
There is a deafening pitter-patter of rain on the road
Because of their lolly their friend is gone
And they’re still too drunk to say “So long”


“I Didn’t Cheat”

You killed my soul
I quit being upbeat
But all sorrows aside
I know I didn't cheat

I fought as long as I could
And tried not to admit defeat
No one won the battles
And I didn't cheat

I could never please you
So consider this my treat
Just to let you know
That I didn't cheat

I tried to be nice
Always caring, dumb, and sweet
But now I'm bold enough to say
I never would cheat

It would have never worked
That's why I kicked you to the street
But I really kept my dignity
To prove I didn't cheat

I held on through the storms
The hail, rain, and sleet
I'll say it was difficult
At least I didn't cheat

You were my biggest mistake
One I will never repeat
I've learned a lot from you
And I still didn't cheat

Every lie you continue to spew
Your words you should eat
At least my words are bona fide
It's true I didn't cheat

You could never break my spirit
But you did make me effete
I'm stronger now and improved
Proud that I didn't cheat

I guess I just got sick and tired
Of enduring your deceit
I'm an honest person
When I say I didn't cheat


“Every time”

Every time I see him, my vision gets a little brighter
Every time I talk to him, my smile gets a little wider
Every time I think of him, my mind gets a little clearer
Every time I get off the phone with him, I sleep a little better
Every time he makes me laugh, my heart feels a little lighter
Every time he puts his arm around me, I can live a little stronger
Every time there's anytime with him, everything just gets a little righter


“The Hair In the Journal”

A hair
Found on a page
In a journal for me
It had belonged to my lover
Right here


“You Are Dangerous”

You are a danger
You cannot be trusted
You should be shunned
You should be locked up
Because you are dangerous

You are a hazard
You cannot be loved
You should be exiled
You should be captured
Because you are hazardous

You are a tumor
You cannot be healed
You should be removed
You should be quarantined
Because you are cancerous

You are a toxin
You cannot be accepted
You should be disposed of
You should be cleaned up
Because you are poisonous

You are a waste of time
To me
To the world
Because you are you


“Your Royal Lowness”

Hail the King of Cruelty
Bow down to the Lord of Low
Kneel before the Duke of Dirt
Kiss the feet of the Prince of Perfidy
All respect the Tsar of Treachery
Regard the Sultan of Scum
Hats off to the Minister of Misery
And lest we forget the Emperor of Evil


“Daddy Longlegs”

Daddy dearest, why are your legs so long?
Your eyes so many; your web is strong
Do you enjoy trapping gnats all day?
Or do you wish you could go outside and play?

Are you happy, Daddy Longlegs, in your silken home?
Sitting and scurrying all day seems like such a drone
What do you think about in your little black head?
Do you dream about what life could be like when you go to bed?

It's dreadful, my long-legged friend
To see your life pass the way you choose to spend
Why don't you stretch those limbs you have and go for a run?
Life out of your web, I promise, will be much more fun


“Escape”

Escape
To get away
From this cage and shackles
From the worries and the troubles
Let’s run


“Serra”

Serra
My second home
To escape my family
Where I am surrounded by friends
My school


“The Wolf”

The wolf
Runs the tundra
On the hunt for his prey
His breath is hot; his heart beats fast
Gorgeous


“I Apologize”

I apologize
For all the rumors and lies
That hurt you inside


“Valentine’s Day 2009”

Its Valentine’s Day
I hate being out of town
Wish I was with you


“Regret This”

I'm gonna tear your heart out
Don't get me wrong; I will
I'm gonna chew it up and spit it out
Maybe you'll get the pain that I felt
I'm gonna rip your eyes out
Now you'll have an excuse to why you didn't see
You didn't see the obvious hurt you were causing me


“Myself”

Call me a nomad
Home is where my heart wanders
Always waiting
Ready to listen
Looks like a car crash
In your eyes staring at your soul
Everything fits together
Found at last
Open to those willing to listen
Read the wind
Not typical; Never average
Always thinking
Coming to a conclusion
And don’t even try to tell me to change


“Homeless”

Hard to swallow
On our own
Miserable at best
Everyday a challenge
Lost in our lives
Eyes glazed with melancholy
So starving; so tired
Such a burden


“Firefly’s Valentine”

The day we went to Vista
To the bus ride from Valhalla
From ice skating and Panda Express
And the blue umbrella
The dew on the grass of all the parks
We’ve ever visited
I can’t help but to look forward
To what the future brings ahead


“Frederick”

From the beginning to the end
Draw upon your memories
Even think about Frances Sargent Osgood
In Edgar Allan Poe’s words
Each endeavor on this page
As is written before your eyes
Try deciphering at your will
If the decoding works well
Frederick is what you spell


“Difference”

Is there really a difference?
Between love and infatuation?
Between true love-making
And instant gratification

Is there really a difference?
Between a lover and a whore?
Passion can be felt by both
But which regards the feelings more?

Is there really a difference?
Between every “I love you?”
Though all are said when it boils down
Which words are spoken true?


“Three”

I know that we will last
The proof is in our past
Because three is a magic number
As long as we remember
Those “three dollars” we owe each other
Three years from now when we can be alone together
A hundred times around the ice took the time of only three
Three competition bus rides on your shoulder I did sleep
Three is the number of Karma’s nature is true
And three is the number of words in the phrase: “I love you”


“Coward”

You decided to run
To run as far as you can
You said you were done
This is my last stand

You might think you are bold
Disappearing from sight
Your tale will not be told
No one will think about you at night

Really you’re just a coward
Running from nothing
You are afraid of the truth and all of the words
So suck it up and quit your crying


“A Dozen Dead Roses”

It's March now
But I don't know how
Why I can't throw away
The roses you gave to me on Valentine's Day

Those dozen white buds
Are now dried duds
To throw them out I'm stalling
Though the dead petals don't stop falling

Call me insane to keep them for so long
But to toss them only feels wrong
Like I'd be trashing your love for me
If I threw the moldy roses out finally


“The Way You Are”

I love every mark upon your face
Every bump, every blemish, every dot
They remind me that you’re human
And not an angel fallen to this spot

I love how you smile
Especially when you show your teeth
There are sparkles in your grinning eyes
Like the stars which I’m beneath

I love the way you smell
Your scent always gets me high
I feel like I’m so lucky
And I’m always asking why


“Sometimes I Wear Them”

Sometimes I wear those rose quartz bracelets
To will him a good day
Sometimes their beads glimmer on my wrist
As I hope to eradicate the pain

And at the end of the day
When I put them down to rest
I can't help but to keep wishing
That today for him was the best


“The Happiest Day”

The happiest day of my life
Will be the day that I die
Because if everything goes right,
You'll be by my side
On the day that I die


“Firefly”

Rise and shine, firefly
The night is at bay
Play your song, firefly
Your mate now awaits


“My Feet Burn”

My
Feet
Are
Burnt

I
Want
To cut
Them off

I should
Have not
Walked on
The hot asphalt

My
Feet
Sure
Do
Hurt


“WWI Original Poem”

A chorus of cries comes to rise
Like a thousand banshee's demise
The screams of men and the shells' cracks
To home those boys will never go back

They run through bullets like horizontal rain
The men feel the resonating echoes in their core
The thump, thump, thump of throbbing pain
This is not the glory they learned in lores about wars

They try to escape the hissing poison gasses fast
Terrified that they will tie their mask last
And fall victim to the voracious fumes
Their lives may survive, but they will always dream of war's inevitable doom
“Slow Down, My Dear”

Slow down, my dear
Don't be hasty now
This will last, I swear
These iron forests of ours will never burn
Dusk will fall fast
But the light in your eyes keeps my world in daylight
Slow down and let the tides lull you to sleep
Dream of me until the morning breaks
And you wash up on the shore


“Sweet”

Revenge, they say, is always sweet
Seeming to be one of life's greatest treats
But really, darling, I'm sorry to say
That candy you crave will shorten your days

The golden honey of revenge
Is served upon a double edge
The blade of Karma's simple spite
Is aimed down your throat waiting for you to take a bite

The nails in the doll that you continue to pound
Are right behind you if you turn around
To strike at one's back seems like a cowardly attack
But Karma knows what she's doing when she lines those nails down your spine


“Psycho”

If "No" means "No"
Then "Leave me alone" means "Leave me alone"
I don't want you in my life
All you do is cause me strife
And my pain gets you high
But yet I keep asking "Why, why, why?"
Why are you the one calling me "Psycho?"


“Captivated”

I am captivated
By your skin; by your smile
Won't you stay here for a while?
For you, I'd go the extra mile
To see your eyes
To taste your lips
Just tell me where
And I'll meet you there


“Blood, Water, and Wine”

Blood, of course, is the family in which you're born
Water is then the friends to whom you're sworn
But, there's one more category of people to meet
Some people aren't water, but wine so sweet

Add the grapes of love and give it plenty of time
And maybe that water just might turn to wine
What runs in my veins, I'm sure I know
I'm positive that both blood and wine flow

Blood is passed on and on through generation stages
Yet wine grows stronger as it ages
Given with time, devotion, and the likes to name
Blood and wine can eventually become the same


“See”

I open my eyes to see
I only see a faint outline shine
That faint outline is just my family
My family's just the beginning of the line

I open my eyes at school
I only see funny fuzziness
The fuzziness are just other students
And the students are just some of the rest

I open my eyes in class
I only see a smudgy smear
That smear is just the teacher
The teacher I cannot see in comparison is mere

I open my eyes outside
I only see a billion blurs
All the blurs are other people
Other people I do not care for

I open my eyes near you
You are all that I see
I see only you and no one else
And I love that you only see me


“A Matter Of Time”

It's only a matter of time
The days that drag by are no friends of mine
Nor are they yours, of course, but the hours are ours
And all we can do is wait patiently in line


“Not What It Seems”

Sometimes things aren't always what they seem to be
There could be a film of lies that prevent you to see
Maybe the Big Bad Wolf wasn't so bad at all
Maybe giants weren't always so tall
Could it be that princesses were always so good?
Or maybe they didn't all behave as they should
Hidden lies lead to secret lovers
Where two enemies in cognito embrace each other
Black and white aren't like night and day
Where the dawn and dusk can act like gray


“When You Think”

When you think all hope is lost
All faith is gone
No chances left
Just dig beneath where your heart still beats
And you might just find some love

“Tawny Doesn’t Like It”

Tawny doesn't like it
When people scream and shout
She doesn't like the violence
When my family's acting out

She always hides in my room
Either on my bed or under the desk
With her tail between her legs
She tries her very best

I feel bad for Tawny
But the yelling she must stand
In any way her ignorance is bliss
For she won't ever understand


“Never Alone”

At least I know
That I'll never be alone
I'm constantly being followed
By a shadow of doubt
My paranoia never leaves my side
So even when it chases people away
I know my paranoia is here to stay


“Who Are We to Judge?”

Who are we to judge?
When hearts wander for the better
To run from their confines
Bind with a third party
To escape the fate of fear
The love for hate falls
Nomadic hearts sprint for their life
Strife kills what never was
To cheat is still to love
And to love, we all cheat ourselves
Cheat ourselves of the pain
Pain handed from heartbreak
But how can a heartbreak,
When no one can claim it?
We are humans
Humans are animals
Beasts by nature
Instinct drives us to find a partner
But our hearts aren't used to multiply with
And who speak for those who don't spawn?
By choice or orientation
Capable or not for those purposes
But we're all capable of love
Capable of leaving, loving, liking
Leaving love; loving likes
Do all lovers love one another?
If so, then the boy who beats his girl
Must love her, no?
The fear isn't love
The fear is lonely
Lonely comes from lack of love
Let's all begin to love
Have no boundary; love the sky
The ocean, the universe
Love infinitely
Love is nothing and
Nothing lasts forever
Love by any means, foul or fair,
Is love nonetheless
For let's remember:
Who are we to judge?


“Webs of Heart”

Silver strands of moonlit thread
Is what creates the spider's web
Strong as steel when first laid down
If cared for enough, it will last long

In her safe haven, she feels happiness
The spider in her lush fortress
The very day her threads were cast
She hoped her bonds were built to last

Spider webs do not last forever
They weaken with time and weather
About a month later a storm started to blow
"Is this the end?" She didn't know

Violent winds and icy rains
Hammered down and caused her pain
Her web once strong but now frayed
Was about to give way

Bonds of web like bonds of heart
Are they withering away? Breaking apart?
Once seemingly unbreakable and strong
Will this withered web last for long?


“No Night”

The stars lost their shine
The cold air only kissed us
The moon never rose


“Don’t Let This Day End”

I try not to look
As the sun sets on your face
Don't let this day end


“Finally”

The world is quiet
It had fallen around us
Now we are alone


“My Star”

Twinkle, twinkle, little star
You'll never realize who you are
Out to you, I'll never call
Not as long as you're amongst them all

Come down to me, mon beau etoile
Compared to you, I feel so small
This close to you feels just right
I love being surrounded by your light

My shining angel, you'll never see
Exactly just how much you mean to me
For as always, it's time we lack
At your heavenly home, you're needed back

Quick before it's time for you to go,
There's one thing that I've wanted you to know
I always search for you at night
And wish you'll fall in love with me tonight


“Warranty”

The seconds turn to centuries
As my heart turns to dust
The gaping hole you shot through me,
Is slowing beginning to rust

But what you miss is what you need
Your heart is really a lock
And the heart you killed was the key
But of course, you had forgot

You're running out of time, my dear
Did you really think we had forever?
Even time runs out with eternity
Our time is now or never

The warranty on your heart has almost come to pass
Be hasty now, or you'll miss your chance
As the sand falls through the glass
So look alive, it's now our time to dance


“Summer’s Chill”

As the summer breeze
Begins to warm the sea
And the sand is searing,
My heart grows cold
And slowly starts to freeze

As the summer heat
Dries the wild wheat
As it rustles in the wind,
You'll be out of reach
And my tears will turn to sleet

As the summer sun
Sets on a day that's done
And the night is just as hot,
This summer holds its chill
It seems the ice has won


“The Elephant”

Distance cannot hide
The elephant in the room
No matter how far


“Warm Starry Skies”

I'm done with lonely summers
I'm ready for the others
When instead of being alone, I'll be with you
Under starry warm skies
Gazing into your eyes
Who said I'll ever have to breathe?


“Love Me, Hate Me”

Love me, hate me
A martyr, a terrorist
A hero, a fiend
A friend, an enemy
There are two sides to every story
So, love me or hate me
But listen to me first


“Cheers”

I raise my glass to you, my love
For all that it was worth
I thought you were something from above
But the glass I raise now, like your feelings, holds a dearth

I've learned that it's unfortunate to toast an empty glass
I remember it held blood, water, and wine for a time so long
And oh, how I remember how we foolishly thought it would last!
But to you now, darling, I sing what is our final swan song

So cheers, my dear dearest dear!
Cheers to your wretched heart
You've lived up to everything I feared
Now we shall take glory in watching it fall apart


“Nirvana”

I've found nirvana at last for sure
It lies not across a plane
It's between those arms of yours
And the way you say my name

It's in the tea you make for me
And the water that falls between us
We find it in between the sheets
But wherever it is, it's never enough

We found it on the pier at night we walk to
And it's in the smell of brine in our hair
In kissing me, it's the way your lips move
I can find nirvana with you anywhere


“Russian Roulette”

Falling for someone is like playing Russian Roulette
You pass the gun and take your bets
You'll have to pull the trigger either way
So cross your fingers and begin to pray

Close your eyes and take a step off the plank
Then hope on your life that the gun shoots a blank
All of your heart, your soul, your mind
Goes into this game we love to play blind

But am I solely speaking about a mere game?
Or is falling in love one of the same?
We take bigger chances the more we invest
Your life versus heart, soul, and mind put to the test

The breath in your lungs versus the love in your heart
Which piece would we rather be apart?
The beat of your heart versus the spring in your step
Which would we rather be rendered inept?

A blow to your heart or one to your head
One or the other and you'll still be dead
But we all die in the end and yet,
We're afraid to play Russian Roulette

So when the dust clears and all is said and done
Open your heart and pull out your gun
Put your finger on the trigger and don't suddenly move
Take a breath and just be brave to say "I love you"


“The Silver Traces”

The silver traces on my face turn to glass and break
They shatter into a thousand mirrors reflecting splinters in their wake

At last be off my face, dreaded mask that hid my eyes!
For I can see once again and now I am wise to your lies

A thousand lies of shattered glass splinters scream your demise reflecting off each other
Now I can't help to wonder when you will rise to paint another

Rise with your brush and lay fine lines of silver on other peoples' faces
Your stain leaving pigments of midnight and ebony mascara in its traces

There is no story to tell and no reason to break down crying tears of shards
Because even if I try, I wouldn't cry! For never again shall I let down my diamond guard

Those thousand glass splinters will never again cut me or merely graze my skin
I have fought this endless battle with my blade of time and now I finally win


“In Your Chair”

Just sitting in your chair
Eating my cereal
While you're away in class
All feels so surreal

So here I sit
In this noisy silence
Wrapped in your brown blanket
Such a great ambiance

Inspired I am
To write this lame poem
But I cannot help it
If this feels like it should be home


“Firefly, Firefly”

Firefly, Firefly
Tear through the sky
Leave this place in desolation
In your trail of immolation
You weren't welcome here anymore
So you took it all to destroy
Firefly, don't lie

Firefly, Firefly
Soaring so high
Searing my lands
Ignite the scars you did brand
My sacred grounds now desecrated
To splinters and cinders they've been obliterated
Firefly wasn't shy

Firefly, Firefly
Leaving me dry
All is now just sand and ash
Incinerated within a flash
Wither me away to a desert
Was this your best effort?
Firefly, nice try

Firefly, Firefly
Even I can't deny
I was the tinder and kindling you sought
We both thirst for blood whenever we fought
This Armageddon was highly anticipated
With all that your apocalypse annihilated
Firefly, I didn't cry


“Found This”

You said you'll be the one for me
But I found someone else and they don't treat me like you do
So you can forget what we ever had
I'm turning my back and I'm letting you off the hook
You bent me until I cracked
And I realized I could do better
So leave
Find another girl to claim
Push her around
Twist her words
I don't like what you say to me
Goodbye


“There Was A Girl”

There was a girl who hated to cry
When asked why, she'd shrug and sigh
But it had to do with how she felt pain
Between us all, it's never the same

The slightest prick in her heart sent her to tears
Usually from mere malevolent glances and leers
And it wasn't at all because she was weak
Her eyes were just prone to springing a leak

Strangers never bothered this surprisingly courageous one
After all, their opinions were just plain dumb
But it was her family that sliced to her core
And with their ways, into her heart they did bore

One cold starry night she looked towards the heavens
And on the trillions of stars, she put all her hopes in
She wished to feel no emotional pain at all
And at that moment out of the sky, a star did fall

From that star, a spirit emerged from the light
(But this gave the brave girl not the least fright)
The spirit rang out with a voice unrestrained:
"From now on, you will feel no emotional pain!"

The girl smiled with glee! Had she finally won?
But the spirit's words were far from done:
"In exchange for the pain you wish not to feel,
You in turn will suffer with pain more real"

But the girl didn't care! She was free at last!
All of her suffering was now of the past!
She boldly went back to face her familiar foes
When they threw insults, she deflected their blows!

When they tried to tear her down, they failed
No matter how hard they tried, she always prevailed!
But what she didn't feel emotionally wasn't denied
The feelings she ignored literally tore apart her insides

One day the family was at it again
At some hour of the night, who knows when?
Screams were exchanged amongst the slamming of doors
Yet no one noticed when the girl fell to the floor

You see, most of all the pain she ever felt
Never meant she was the target where damage was dealt
It used to tear up emotions at heart
To see her parents and sister splitting apart

Now instead of attacking the abstract,
The pain she felt was as physical as facts
Every argument, skirmish, and fight
Brought the innocent girl closer to her plight

Now she laid on the floor with her heart collapsed
Unnoticed, hours upon hours had already passed
She wondered what went wrong and why
As her last thoughts before she died

Where do you find a moral in this?
What was so selfish about her wish?
Why wasn't she able to get away?
From her family's turmoil, she had to pay

Pay attention to those you affect around you
They don't always feel as you thought you knew
Suffering varies for every person in the world
So please remember this story of the girl


“Cascade”

I shimmer in the light to the world outside
They don't see within what I tend to hide
Beneath my diamond shell and adamant armor
Is a world of what is weak and much softer

So like I've said now before
They don't see past these doors
Never do I let them inside
Because underneath all my defenses have died

But I've let you into myself lo and behold
Is it just like everything that you've been told?
A wonderland of crystalline azure tears
Fleeing from all of my objectified fears

Falling waters of cerulean
To sapphire ponds they dance again
Cascades of brine rains from the skies
Drenching below navy blue lies

Tumbling drops of indigo
Give you the sense of vertigo
And deep teals will lull you to sleep
To the sounds of my internal weeps

Waves of the sobbing surf crash
One after another forever it lasts
This is not my diamond coated shell,
But a place where oceans are my hell

So I've let you in. That's cool, now what?
Don't slip on what seeped from the cuts
Why aren't you repulsed or averted?
Or do you see this realm inverted?

Come stop the cascades with your smile
And hold my blue world for a while
You mend it just by the warmth of your hands
When the tears drain away, we'll have a place to stand


“Truck”

The truck plays its in-reverse song
Beep, beep, beep
A simple melody


“Language”

I didn't realize you spoke another language
Until you had let me know
Now we're lost in miscommunication
And ultimately found a low

But through the clouds we came to see
That we had meant the same
The storm that howled above us
Is now suddenly tame

We harnessed that storm and called it ours
To channel two tongues into one
The same emotions we let loose to fly
Now a storm of passion sure to stun


“Pandora”

You took a look inside
And peeked at what I tried to hide
For what was Pandora's demise,
A journey for us gave rise

Across the skies, the stars, the milky way
To the edges of the universe every day
My sweet Pandora, I'll paint it all for you
The galaxies, the planets, and the nebulae too

Our days together like beads on a string
Countless and many since I've been under your wing
Each bead a pearl and an oyster each our world
Pandora, do you see what you unfurled?


“To”

To crawl under your skin
Is where I would win

To tangle myself in your hair
Any other way is unfair

To get lost in your eyes
Until one of us dies

To taste your lips
Sweet nectar in sips

To breathe only your scent
Is a day well-spent

To fly through your thoughts
And never get caught


“Golden”

Out, out she bursts forth from her golden cage
We all know what is said about those in this age
But before she flees she will first forge
A pair of golden wings from what was her scourge

And she's off running quick as lightning on her feet
Cantering, galloping, and then too fast to count a beat
Like a bullet or arrow through the wind she tears
And takes to the skies and beyond she will dare

Her heart burns through all that gets in her way
Her spirit was an apocalypse before this very day
And her mind is turning at the speed of light
While her soul becomes something of cauterizing might

She dangerous, nonconforming, and free as a bird
All of her bruises, cuts, and broken bones have been cured
In her flurry she remembered who she was before
Preceding her imprisonment behind those golden doors

And now she has left us all in the midst
As we question if this seraph really did exist
Where is she now and her inferno heart?
Probably in a better life she could finally start


“She’s Been On My Mind”

She's been on my mind
If I could only tell her
She makes me speechless


“When I Try To Sleep”

When I try to sleep
If I am lucky enough
She visits my dreams


“Web of Lies”

Falling into my web of lies
I can't stop it, but I never try
You'll become my prey just like the rest
They tried to run, they tried their best
My threads are sticky, sickly sweet
Woven together by lustful heat
And if you escape by any way
you still won't live to see another day
Trusting me will end your life
After enduring mortal strife
I'll weave your heart like I wove my web
It just takes a few words to get you in bed
You're all so easy to please and trick
Sometimes I think it's you, not me, who's sick
You don't think with your mind, you think with your lust
And I say I'm the one you shouldn't trust?
So go on and fight it, tooth and nail
But in the end you'll always fail
I'm the mistress of puppets and the queen of deceit
I play my game and never cheat
I'll take your breath away and you'll think you've won
But for stealing breaths there are more ways than one
I'll roll my lips and pierce with my gaze
You'll fall into a sinner's haze
Then I'll take you home with me
And you'll enjoy the last night you'll ever see


“Another Notch on the Door Frame”

One, two, three, four
They all line up outside my door
Five, six, seven, eight
They've never thought to hesitate


“Your Biggest Mistake”

I'd stop where you are
Turn back, run far
Please don't enter here
Unless you want your end near
I'm poison I tell you, I'm toxic I swear
I'm the wolf, the tiger, and the bear
Get out while you can, I warn
You're about to wish you've never been born
You're about to enter a world of pain
Of suffering, breakage, and emotional strain
Don't hunt me for the thrill of the chase
I promise you, I'll lay you to waste
I'm unable to be loved, it's true
I'll turn your heart black and blue
I'll tear you to pieces and spit you out
I can't explain what this is all about
Just know that it's better to keep away
Please promise me that you won't stay
I don't want to hurt you, I really don't
But it's impossible to say that I won't
Just like the others who now lie cold
You're being stupid, not brave or bold


“The Next Record”

I'm addicted to lust
I'm not one you should trust
And in all honesty
You don't want to have me
I love to eat hearts
To tear them apart
It's a game! It's a thrill!
To see whose heart I can kill
I want them all
But quickly they fall
As I cut them down
And they hit the ground
I can only laugh and smile
"That one sure stayed a while!"
I wonder what the next record will be
For how long they can bear to survive me


“I Never Asked For This”

I fell from my grace in the kingdom of clouds
Torn from my eyes was my illusion shroud
I can only look down
As I come hurtling to the ground

I took the route I thought was the right way
But on that path, I managed to stray
Now I’m lost in the woods; hungry and cold
Terrified; I wish I were bold

The creatures surrounded me and there is no escape
Their eyes glow red on dark massive shapes
It’s only a matter of time before they bite
And chew my bones until they are trite


“For Once”

Please put my heart to rest
In tin and iron forests
And let us go ahead
Where oceans are mercury and lead
Where we don’t do as we’re told
And stars burn magnesium and gold

Because I wish I could get lost
In tin and iron woods
And it’s okay by me to drown
In mercury and lead seas
I’ll wait for stars to fall in the cold
Burning magnesium and gold


“Wonderland”

It all makes sense to us
Our own little wonderland
So open your heart and stay hushed
And let me take you by the hand
A world we built on our own
Where whispers die young
A secret between you and me


“The Only One That Cared”

The only one that cared
Doesn’t care for you any more
Because what you had gone and done
Has shaken her to the core


“Equator”

This sense of longing
Makes the equator seem short
Why so far away?


“Days”

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
I will cry
If I don’t see you by Saturday,
I think I just might die


“Lead”

That “silver lining” in the clouds
Isn’t so silver at all
There’s no hope in those misty shrouds
It’s all just toxic lead ready to fall

I dare you all to wake up and see
This is really what I mean
In the sky just lead and mercury
Just promise me not to breathe

All roads eventually lead to nowhere
After all, the world is round
There’s no rush; we’ll all get there
For death’s the only place we’re bound

So stop your searching and quit looking up
Kill the fairy tales in your head
That silver lining never was
It was all just mercury and lead


“Secrets of the Shore”

The rise of tides too high for land eyes
Upon the shore cold and moist
Mist is gray and gone the sun
Just clouds have come and come
A drizzle of drops no different than the sprinkles the sea spews
Smells of salt and sand seethes swirling the senses
Bloated corpses of creatures brought by the brine
Kelp lies limp in lines upon the seaside
Licked by frigid foam for hours
The barren beach bears no breath of life
Low lapping waves like ice
Threaten to tear these eyes from the shore
Whispers of secrets only the sea knows


“The end of our tale”

The end of our tale
All of the nights forgotten
Who are you again?


“The Pull”

The rain pounds upon the pane
Like how my heart heavily beats
I’ve tried to take control
But now I admit defeat

Your embrace enchants me
An endorphin rush I receive
Then I’m lost in love and lust
Just in time for me to leave

My heart remains on a string
Tugging tightly towards you
So I’ll just listen to the rain
And I wonder if you hear it too


“The Cave-in”

My chest finally caves in
Caring not for what I’ve lost,
But instead for what I’ll win
My heart was already ice and frost

This wasn’t the first
And certainly not the last
Many times my bubble has burst
But this time I bleed too fast

Of all the debris that falls away
The sharpest pieces still remain
For a while I’m sure they’ll stay
It all hurts just the same

I guess I’ll try to clear the rubble
I’m so used to this routine
I’ll patch up my little bubble
Then maybe I’ll build a new dream


“The Dust”

No one asks where the dust has been
As it fills your nose and eyes
The droughts, fires, storms, and wind
Have now replaced your lies

The driest bones have been bleached white
And the tumbleweeds whisper to the dirt
The sun blazes down upon your losing fight
Who would have known these secrets would hurt?


“The Taste of Ink”

Fresh ink cuts my tongue
Have all battles now been won?
For where the rain comes down black
Stains my heart and stings my back
To wash the bitter world away
And fill it completely in with clay
No life breathing, no heart beating
Not while all my trust is fleeting
Trust myself and no one dies
All set free by my lies
This canvas hungers for flesh and blood
But all I have to offer is mud
It consumes me; lusts and leaves me
Blackened eyes; no longer can see
I'm just a paper tiger kept at bay
I've wandered out and lost my way
The story is over, but at what cost?
At the end of this chapter, I know I've lost


“Surgery”

Pin my heart down to a tray
Cut it open, slice away
Find the purer parts that have gone astray
Remove the rot that changed my ways

Take away tissues grown from greed
Leave only the chambers that I need
Cauterize the ends that bleed
This heart is full of darkened deeds

Give back my life to me
Hit my heart with electricity
The beat is what I want to see
Clean again I want to be


“Hear”

I can't understand a single word you say
The tears that fall down your cheeks have chased your voice away
Speak clear to me like the crystals in those tears
We'll work things out and dissipate your fears
But it's hard to begin when your words are afraid to come
The silence that is screaming now leaves my heart numb


“Untitled Contrast”

Blackened fur like tar in the night
Pushing through the air with might
A summer breeze to tease the senses
Miseries are now past tenses

White as the light reflected in dew
She writes a poem; a piece for you
One eye brown and one eye teal
She cares for you quite a deal

Gleaming teeth like daggers drawn
Scars are just the past's pawns
A burning heart so full of ash
In further confusion, these two crashed

Across the white paper is black ink
Together embraced is the link
A poem written here is a simple gift
To reach across the Pacific rift


“Jawbone”

Under your jaw, I plant my lips
I breathe in your scent and give you a kiss
It is brief and quick, this I know
I still can feel the warmth of your throat


“Together We Make Gray”

As my ink conquers the lines
Of these pages all the time
I feel that there is so much more
Than the black and white I've been going for

But when rainbow colors are overdone
I realize all I need is one
And you are the one I found
So be the one to whom I'm bound

We create a million shades of gray
A different flavor for every day
Why should we be just black and white,
When gray feels much more right?

By the rate I'm flying through these pages
It wouldn't take me ages
To write a perfect poem for you
If you keep making me feel the way you do


“On Letting Go”

Kiss me again so I'll never forget
Every moment I always regret
Reach across the endless sea
To extend your broken words to me

Pull me apart at the seams
Seems like a fair fate to me
“Yes!” I know I'll scream and cry
So you can love me 'till I die

Even if I rot away
Never forget who I am today
Crave my heart and tears again
May as well enjoy them while you can

Grow inside my empty husk
Watch the lights fade to dusk
And once you've had your fill of me
Serenade my soul to sleep

All alone I'll call your name
But truths and lies are all the same
And now so well you I know
It makes it easier to let go


“Seattle”

I saved my money for a rainy day,
But here every day the skies are gray
I have decided to leave as soon as tomorrow,
On the way home I'll ride out my sorrows

They say that this place is lucky to have rain,
But they don't live in this flooded terrain
I'll take the sunshine and drought of home,
Instead of drowning here cold and alone


“Forced Loneliness”

Hello, my dear, we meet again
In my absence, have you made friends?
Well, if you did, it's such a shame
You invited them, but they never came

You wonder if it's because of you
But, surprise surprise! It's my fault too
I've cursed you hard to be alone
A spiteful spell since I've come home

It's just me they want to see most
But they'll visit you if you're the host
My dear, I am now the key
You'll be alone if you're not around me


“You suck at hosting”

The hatred and rage
When I look at your face
I can't turn away

The silence of night
Bonfire burns bright
I wish I could hide

Music plays now
It's not too loud
I could just drown

The evening grows old
The night is our own
I want to go home


“One Word Response”

Just one word for every reply
A single arrow that you let fly
I'm not sure if this is even an attack
When you only send one word back

If this is a hint, I don't want to know
But I can't ignore this protruding arrow
I just want to continue this conversation
But something's lost in the translation

When we spoke before, our words never ended
Sentences and phrases always extended
I missed the times I talked to you
And you gave words back to me too


“Come with me”

Come with me
We can pass the waves
And be claimed by the sea

It will sting at first
But to keep it inside?
This will prevent the worst

Tread water to stay afloat
Burn your bottled energy
Taste the salt in your throat

If you can't tread any more
I'll pull you back
We'll return to shore

Your hand in my hand
You don't have to do this alone
We can rest on the warm sand

But first you must come with me
I know you can hear me now
So let us go to the sea


“Infinite Loop”

I am an infinite loop
The wolf chasing the moon
Silver and white
Lonely too
Forever following the moon

I'll keep on going
But I'll crash soon
A few seconds are forever
It's all relative
And I will crash relatively soon

Trapped in an infinite loop
A leg in an iron jaw
Red and white
Lonely too
Forever calling for the moon


“Bitter”

This bitterness makes it hard to breathe
My blood boils and I bare my teeth
All in all, it's a lost connection
You're too far gone for my protection

I don't know where this anger breeds
But when it sprouts, it grows like weeds
And then I've lain waste to all that you've known
I don't bother to hide since my cover's been blown

Once I thought 'all is fair in love and war'
But now curse those words that I had sworn
There is no love, no reason, no rhyme
To take back all of this bitter time


“The Vessel”

The weight bears heavier than the sea
Pulling on all the cords of being me
Where I had been blind, this vessel filled up
Every second a drip, every moment a drop

And now it sits upon my shoulders
I can not stop it from spilling over
All I hope is that it can stand to contain
At least enough for our time frame


“Relevant”

You say this is love but it feels like obsession
I'm holding your heart forced in my possession
You make it hard to contain when it's already frail
Or maybe perhaps I'm being set up to fail


“Setting Everything Back Into Place”

I'm the doctor and I don't know what I'm doing
I'm the surgeon and the parts just aren't moving
I called the ambulance and it never came
I'll trade my own body so things could be the same

The most comforting thought rests deep in my head
With either outcome, I'll likely end up dead
So let me decide which way I want to go
My obsessive love for you is all that I know

Please take it all: My bones, my flesh, my humors
Discard the rest: My pain, my demons, my tumors
I'll give all of me to mend all of you
Ever string of this fractured heart sings true


“Burnt Body”

Driven by dread: Bright flames and a burning body
Is this what you have imagined for so long?
Feel nothing for there is nothing
Empty words fill my swan song

Seared skin like tar and ebony now
Cracked and smoldering by flame
Your apathy got the best of me
But I'm the one you blame


“I want to write a song with you”

I want to write a song with you
I want to feel your touch
Through the notes you play for me
I want to feel the rush
Captivate me with your voice
As you've always done
I want to hear the music in your heart
Tell me I'm the one

I want to write a song with you
That we both feel inside
Transport us far away once more
A new and wild ride
Take my hand and hold it tight
As you used to do
Let the lyrics speak for us
I'm becoming new

I want to write a song with you
Please just give me time
I'll be as whole as the chords we produce
Full of roars and chimes
Give me all your love in lyrics
As you've always known
All we need is rhythm now
To find our way back home


“Tool”

You breathe "I love you's" into my ear
It's hot and heavy like all of my fears
Those three words that I need
Said only when you're inside me

And when you're out, there's nothing left
I may as well have been born deaf
That simple line is lost in space
Like smoke dispersing from this place

Here I've become your pleasure tool
I know deep down I'm being fooled
But if it brings me close to you
There's nothing that I'd rather do


“Diphenhydramine HCL”

Diphenhydramine
Sing a lullaby to me
How many do I have to take
To guarantee I will not wake?


“Can We Just Be?”

You and me
Can we just be?
In this world of wanton gray
You bring the sun up every day

A fantasy
Within the trees
Here amongst the evergreens
Your light filters through the leaves

You are all I see
When we sing with glee
In between each drop of rain
A sideways glance before the refrain


“Under The Arizona Sun”

Reach across the desert high
Purple mountains touch the sky
I see endless blue all around
But all I want to see is you

The desert is in full bloom
Saguaro flowers kiss the moon
Coyotes sing another round
But all I want to hear is you

In this paradise I'm missing your eyes
With all these colors shown
They're not the colors that I've known
I search the dew for signs of you
Under the rising Arizona sun
I know you're not here
But my search continues on

I'll return in due time
To the forests where you reside
Where nothing there is dry
But all I want is to find you


“Champagne Poems”

Letting go and morning kisses.
Champagne poems my body misses.
Keep me in your thoughts tonight
Embraces filling me with light
I've been far too gone for far too long
Lost my voice to a stagnant song
Throat lined by bitter salt
Heart set free from a vault
We drown in twine to which we bound
Our wrists and lips it wraps around
This thread resides deep inside
Connection like a promise to abide
In due time our flowers bloom
Blossoms brighter than the moon
There's something here we both feel
Intricate and infinite like a wheel


“4:32”

It's 4:32
And I can't sleep
I'm thinking about you
I won't see you
Until noon
I toss and turn
What should I do?
Every minute I'm awake
I'm counting seconds
Waiting for dawn to break


“Those Three Words”

Those three words: a spell.
When uttered first they hold fast.
Before my heart breaks.


“Return”

This ample love blooms and spreads
Like wildflowers taking over my head
Pruned all too soon by prosaic shears
These gilded fetters that I hold dear

I want to go back to those carnival nights
Where neon foxes danced in flashing lights
And not even these quatrains could restrain
The boundless endorphins I had maintained

I'm spilling these words; I'm rusty, I know
Three years of rain has tarnished my flow
The ability to rhyme once again sets me free
These verses will nourish the wolf inside me


“Untitled Weariness”

This weariness within stretches me thin
The walls I built again are caving in
Now that my insides have turned green
Please don't wake me from this dream
I'm not sure how much time we have
And I can't promise that we'll last

Just let me hold you tight again
I don't know where we would begin
I'm falling fast, I'm calling out
I can't see your face in this crowd
Please don't leave, I can't follow
This kingdom I've built I won't forego


“Untitled Finale”

Here’s to our summer
When we fell together

The arms that vowed to catch me
Have fallen from my sight

The wings that hold me now
Are the ones I've grown myself

And when the air turns cold
I know it's not your own

You bet I'll use these same four chords
For now it's all I know


“Montecito”

I remember seeing signs for Montecito
It meant we were getting close

About four hours on the road
In the van or your car enclosed

When I saw the signs for Montecito,
It meant I was nearly home.

Not the home you raised me in,
but rather one I made my own.

Mussel Shoals, Carpinteria, Summerland, Montecito
Counting the minutes and the miles

If I ever brought it up to you,
I know you would deny it


“Poison control”

Because your misery now makes me so happy
I'll never let this die as long as I'm alive

And though I'm over you I'll keep singing this tune
So maybe I'll profit from what you put me through

Your friends had to call poison control
And now I just want you to know
I don't actually care what happens to you

I'm justified in my ways
You put me through all of this pain
But I've learned to see it through
