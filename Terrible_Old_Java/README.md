# CharPoetryGen
CharPoetryGen draws from a collection of all the poems I have written in the past ten+ years. This self-driven project is an adventure in Object-Oriented Programming. 

Forms of poetry that can be generated include:
* Couplets, quatrains
* Haiku, tanka
* [Coming soon] Sonnets
* [Coming soon]
